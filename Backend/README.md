Welcome to the hymnusStrategiespiel24 project! This document provides an overview of how to properly initialize the system to ensure smooth functionality.

## Object Initialization Order

To set up the system correctly, follow these steps in the specified order:

1. **Cities:** Begin by creating all the cities that will be part of the game. This step is crucial because it establishes the foundational locations for the entire system.

2. **Paths:** After creating the cities, define the paths that connect these cities. Paths represent the trade routes between cities and are essential for facilitating trade operations.

3. **Distance Refresh:** With cities and paths in place, perform a distance refresh. This process calculates and updates the shortest paths from each city to Rome (or a central city) to ensure accurate distance-based calculations throughout the system.

4. **Teams:** Finally, create and initialize the teams. With cities, paths, and distances already set, teams can be integrated into the system and begin engaging in trade activities.

By following this sequence, you will ensure that all dependencies are properly established, allowing the system to function as intended.

For more details on each step, refer to the corresponding sections in the documentation.

Happy strategizing!
